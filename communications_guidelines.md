# Communication Guidelines
These guidelines are applicable when acting as a representative of Matplotlib (for example at sprints or when giving official talks or tutorials) and in the following community venues managed by Matplotlib:
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
* https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
* https://gitter.im/matplotlib/ 
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotblog 
* https://twitter.com/matplotlib
* https://instagram.com/matplotart/
* https://www.tiktok.com/@matplotart
* mailing lists:
    * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-announce
    * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users
    * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel

## Social Media Coordination Communication Channels:
team mailing list: matplotlib-social@numfocus.org
public chat room: https://gitter.im/matplotlib/community 

## Content Guidelines:
- stick to Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib
- also acceptable topics: Python, Visualization, NumFOCUS libraries
- no gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools; criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose
- follow visualization communication best practices
    - don't share non-expert visualizations when it could be harmful
      - put on meeting agenda when answer isn't clearly to hold off on sharing. 
    - clearly state when the visualization data/conclusions cannot be verified
      - do not rely on machine translations for sensitive visualizations
    - example: https://twitter.com/matplotlib/status/1244178154618605568
- verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog)
    - Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content 
    - make sure content is clearly cited
        - example: a tutorial using someone else’s example clearly cites the original source
- Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable, but should be no more than about a quarter of the content of the blog/discourse post. 
- if you think content is borderline, ask before publishing it 
- acceptable image guide:
    - union of site guidelines favoring caution:
        - keep  it geared towards science/data visualization, and non-controversial images

## Accessibility
- add alt text to images and videos when the platform allows
    - https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/
    - https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81
- warn on bright, strobing, images & turn off autoplay if possible
- for images made by the social media team:
  - make graphic perceivable to people who cannot perceive color well, due to color-blindness or low vision
  - do not make bright, strobing images 
  - more guidelines at https://webaim.org/techniques/images/
       
## Behavior Guidelines
- keep responses polite, assume user statements are in good faith unless they violate the [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)

## Recurrent Social Media Campaigns:
- Release Announcements
    - Highlight new features & major deprecations
    - Link to download/install instructions
    - Ask folks to try it out. 
- signal  boost third party packages
- GSOC work during GSOC recruiting and work times
- John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners

## Social Media Following Guide:
- only follow organizations/projects - mostly numfocus projects 
    - especially 3rd party packages
    - should at least be visualization related
    - sponsors are also acceptable
- do not follow individual accounts for any reason (even maintainers/project leads/Guido!) 

## Twitter Persona
* Is a sentient visualization library, so talks about itself as a we, us, our, and it. Avoids talking about itself in the 3rd person. 
* Very earnest, eager to please, and aims to be patient & painfully oblivious to snark and sarcasm.  
* Gets over-excited over shiny visualizations - lots of emojis and the like - and encourages folks to share their work. 
* Highlights various parts of the library, especially the more obscure bits and bobbles. 
* Acknowleges that it is a sometimes frustrating tangle of bits & bobbles that can confuse even the folks who work on it & signal boosts their confuzzlment.
