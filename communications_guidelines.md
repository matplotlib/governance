# Communication Guidelines
These guidelines are applicable when acting as a representative of Matplotlib (for example at sprints or when giving official talks or tutorials) and in the following community venues managed by Matplotlib:
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
* https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
* https://gitter.im/matplotlib/ 
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotblog 
* https://twitter.com/matplotlib
* https://instagram.com/matplotart/
* https://www.tiktok.com/@matplotart
* mailing lists:
    * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-announce
    * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users
    * https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel

## Content Guidelines:
- stick to Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib
- also acceptable topics: Python, Visualization, NumFOCUS libraries
- no gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools; criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose
- follow visualization communication best practices
    - don't share non-expert visualizations when it could be harmful
      - put on meeting agenda when answer isn't clearly to hold off on sharing. 
    - clearly state when the visualization data/conclusions cannot be verified
      - do not rely on machine translations for sensitive visualizations
    - example: https://twitter.com/matplotlib/status/1244178154618605568
- verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog)
    - Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content 
    - make sure content is clearly cited
        - example: a tutorial using someone elseâ€™s example clearly cites the original source
- Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable, but should be no more than about a quarter of the content of the blog/discourse post. 
- if you think content is borderline, ask before publishing it 
- acceptable image guide:
    - union of site guidelines favoring caution:
        - keep  it geared towards science/data visualization, and non-controversial images 
    - site guidelines:

        - https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119

## Accessibility
- add alt text to images and videos when the platform allows
    - https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/
    - https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81
- warn on bright, strobing, images & turn off autoplay if possible
- for images made by the social media team:
  - make graphic perceivable to people who cannot perceive color well, due to color-blindness or low vision
  - do not make bright, strobing images 
  - more guidelines at https://webaim.org/techniques/images/
       
## Behavior Guidelines
- keep responses polite, assume user statements are in good faith unless they violate the [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)

## Recurrent Social Media Campaigns:
- Release Announcements
    - Highlight new features & major deprecations
    - Link to download/install instructions
    - Ask folks to try it out. 
- signal  boost third party packages
- GSOC work during GSOC recruiting and work times
- John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners

## Social Media Following Guide:
- only follow organizations/projects - mostly numfocus projects 
    - especially 3rd party packages
    - should at least be visualization related
    - sponsors are also acceptable
- do not follow individual accounts for any reason (even maintainers/project leads/Guido!) 

## Twitter Persona
* Is a sentient visualization library, so talks about itself as a we, us, our, and it. Avoids talking about itself in the 3rd person. 
* Very earnest, eager to please, and aims to be patient & painfully oblivious to snark and sarcasm.  
* Gets over-excited over shiny visualizations - lots of emojis and the like - and encourages folks to share their work. 
* Highlights various parts of the library, especially the more obscure bits and bobbles. 
* Acknowleges that it is a sometimes frustrating tangle of bits & bobbles that can confuse even the folks who work on it & signal boosts their confuzzlment. 

## Changes to Guidelines
Changes to the communications guidelines must be reviewed by the community manager and changes to specific platform guidlines (e.g. twitter, instagram) must be reviewed by the person responsible for that platform when different from the community manager. If there is no consensus, decisions about communications guidelines revert to the community manager.
