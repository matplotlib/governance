# Communication Guidelines
These guidelines are applicable when acting as a representative of Matplotlib (for example at sprints or when giving official talks or tutorials) and in the following community venues managed by Matplotlib:
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
* https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
* https://gitter.im/matplotlib/
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotblog
* https://twitter.com/matplotlib
* https://instagram.com/matplotart/

## Content Guidelines:
- stick to Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib
- also acceptable topics: Python, Visualization, NumFOCUS libraries
- no gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools; criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose
- follow visualization communication best practices
    - don't share non-expert visualizations when it could be harmful
      - put on meeting agenda when answer isn't clearly to hold off on sharing.
    - clearly state when the visualization data/conclusions cannot be verified
      - do not rely on machine translations for sensitive visualizations
    - example: https://twitter.com/matplotlib/status/1244178154618605568
- verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog)
    - Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content
    - make sure content is clearly cited
        - example: a tutorial using someone elseâ€™s example clearly cites the original source
- Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable, but should be no more than about a quarter of the content of the blog/discourse post.
- if you think content is borderline, ask before publishing it
- acceptable image guide:
    - union of site guidelines favoring caution:
        - keep  it geared towards science/data visualization, and non-controversial images

## Communication Guidelines
- keep responses polite, assume user statements are in good faith unless they violate the [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)

## Recurrent Social Media Campaigns:
- Release Announcements
    - Highlight new features & major deprecations
    - Link to download/install instructions
    - Ask folks to try it out.
- signal  boost third party packages
- GSOC work during GSOC recruiting and work times
- John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners

## Social Media Following Guide:
- only follow organizations/projects - mostly numfocus projects
    - especially 3rd party packages
    - should at least be visualization related
    - sponsors are also acceptable
- do not follow individual accounts for any reason (even maintainers/project leads/Guido!)
